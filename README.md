Mastermind game in JS (etc)


TODO:

overall game controls (replay, scoring?, etc.)

fix bug where it says you failed if you win on last turn

also game must STOP after win/lose (currently does not)

nicer visuals, some effects and animations, etc.

use media queries to make it bigger on bigger screens (but at least I designed mobile-first this time!)
